## A Go file consists of the following parts:
  - Package declaration:  In Go, every program is part of a package. We define this using the package keyword.
  - Import packages
  - Functions
  - Statements and expressions

## Go Statements
  - In Go, statements are separated by ending a line (hitting the Enter key) or by a semicolon ";".
  - Hitting the Enter key adds ";" to the end of the line implicitly (does not show up in the source code).
